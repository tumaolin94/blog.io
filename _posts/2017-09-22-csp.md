## Constraint Satisfaction Problem

A set of <Variables X, Domains D, Constraints C>

X<sub>i</sub> must take its value from D<sub>i</sub>.

D have to be a finite set of integers instead of a real-valued domain that would include an infinite number of real-values between two bounds.

#### CSPs are a special kind of problem:

##### states defined by values of a fixed set of variables

##### goal test defined by constraints on variable values


#### Backtracking = depth-first search with one variable assigned per node


#### Variable ordering and value selection heuristics help significantly


#### Forward checking prevents assignments that guarantee later failure


#### Constraint propagation (e.g., arc consistency) does additional work to constrain values and detect inconsistencies


#### Iterative min-conflicts is usually effective in practice
