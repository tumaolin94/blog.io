# Reproduce:ArrayList vs. LinkedList vs. Vector
Referrence: [https://dzone.com/articles/arraylist-vs-linkedlist-vs](https://dzone.com/articles/arraylist-vs-linkedlist-vs)

`ArrayList`, `LinkedList` and `Vector` all implement `List` interface. They are very similar to use. Their main difference is their implementation which causes different performance for different operations.  

`ArrayList` is implemented as a resizable array. As more elements are added to ArrayList, its size is increased dynamically. It's elements can be accessed directly by using the get and set methods, since ArrayList is essentially an array. 

`LinkedList` is implemented as a double linked list. Its performance on add and remove is better than Arraylist, but worse on get and set methods. 

`Vector` is similar with ArrayList, but it is synchronized. ArrayList is a better choice if your program is thread-safe. Vector and ArrayList require space as more elements are added. Vector each time doubles its array size, while ArrayList grow 50% of its size each time. LinkedList, however, also implements Queue interface which adds more methods than ArrayList and Vector, such as offer(), peek(), poll(), etc.    

Note: The default initial capacity of an ArrayList is pretty small. It is a good habit to construct the ArrayList with a higher initial capacity. This can avoid the resizing cost.  

## Performance of ArrayList vs. LinkedList 

The time complexity comparison is as follows:

The difference of their performance is obvious. LinkedList is faster in add and remove, but slower in get. Based on the complexity table and testing results, we can figure out when to use ArrayList or LinkedList. 
In brief, LinkedList should be preferred if: 
### there are no large number of random access of element
### there are a large number of add/remove operations
