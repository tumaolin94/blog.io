This problem occurs while using control `RangeValidation`. And the answer I can use is following.


In `webconfig` and search for:
```
        <appSettings>
        <add key=" aspnet:UseTaskFriendlySynchronizationContext" value="true" />
         <add key="ValidationSettings:UnobtrusiveValidationMode" value="WebForms" />
         </appSettings>
```
Delete `<add key="ValidationSettings:UnobtrusiveValidationMode" value="WebForms" />`
 

If there are no words above, adding `<add key="ValidationSettings:UnobtrusiveValidationMode" value="None" />` in 'appSettings
        
At last, fresh your page.
